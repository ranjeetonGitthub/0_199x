  Final year student pursuing Master in Computer Application From LLoyd institute of Engineering and Technology at Greater Noida. I am skilled in full-stack web development and problem solving. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is C++, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am also familiar with Recoil, postgreSQL, TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer/engineer.
